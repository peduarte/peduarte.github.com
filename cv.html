        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>I've always loved the web. I learnt HTML when I was 12 and built a very <abbr title="noun: red colour or pigment.">red</abbr> website about myself. It was hosted on Geocities.</p>
        <p>I was born in Brazil and at the age of 13 (2002), me and my family moved to England. In 2005, I picked up web development again, and by then things had changed slightly. There was this new thing called CSS that I had never heard of.</p>
        <p>I then started freelancing and building websites for family, friends and small businesses. I quickly became extremely passionate about design and user experience.</p>
        <p>Now I'm currently <strong>freelancing</strong>. Previously, I was working for one of the top advertising agencies in the world, R/GA, where I built websites and web apps for multi-million pound companies.</p>
        <p>I take a lot of pride in my work and I am always eager to improve and learn new technologies. I am a great team player and collaborator with design/ux teams.</p>
        <p>My ideal way of working is by developing <strong>prototypes</strong> as proof of concept and building <strong>styleguides</strong> in order to keep track of all the modules and make sure the styles are consistent.</p>
        <h2>Career History</h2>
        <h3>Fluxx » Senior front end developer and Prototype Developer (Jan 2015 - Feb 2015)</h3>
        <p>I was taken oboard to help facilitate the onboarding proccess for new business clients of Lloyds Bank. I was responsible for the user experience, UI design and development. My task was to implement a better UI/UX and use front end technologies to help the sign up process become much easier and faster for the users.</p>
        <h3>Stinkdigital » Senior front end developer (August 2014 - December 2014)</h3>
        <p>I was responsible for the front end architecture of the project, making sure the website is fully responsive, accessible, optimised and scalable. I am focusing on building a clean, re-usable and well documented framework so any future developers will have no problem picking it up if they need to.</p>
        <p>Technologies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gulp</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>R/GA » Open standards developer (October 2011 - August 2014)</h3>
        <p>I started at R/GA as a Presentation Code Developer. but quickly got promoted to Open Standards Developer.</p>
        <p>As I'm sure you know, R/GA is a brilliant agency to work for. Their client list is incredible. And I've had the pleasure of working for a lot of them. Being part of amazing projects of all different sorts.</p>
        <p>I've built simple static sites using tools such as <strong>Jekyll</strong> to scalable object-oriented platforms using frameworks such as <strong>AngularJS</strong>.</p>
        <p>I have also architectured and delivered detailed <strong>styleguides</strong> to clients, the latest one was for Google, where I led the front end development.
